"Day 5" section of the Python bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
introduces the use of for-loop.

The below "Day 5" exercises uses for-loops on top of previously covered python concepts:

1 - Add_even_numbers.py: Uses a for-loop to Add all even numbers in range 1 to 100.

2 - Find_high_score.py: User inputs a list of test scores (separated by space) and
    returns the high score. For example, if the input is "87 72 34 67 91 54",
    the output returns as "91".

3 - FizzBizz_generator.py: A common coding problem which used a for loop to iterate
    thorough numbers from 1 to 100 and prints "Fizz" for modulo 3 numbers,
    "Bizz" for modulo 5 numbers, and "FizzBizz" for numbers that are both modulo 3 and 5.

4 - Random_Password_generator_my_solution.py: User prompts for number of
    letters, symbols, and numbers to be used in created password. Then for-loops
    are used to create substrings of letters, symbols, and numbers before
    appending them together into a final password string.

5 - Students_height_average.py: prompts user to list the heights of students separated
    via space. After turning the heights into a list, a for-loop iterates and sums
    the heights when calculating the average.
