For "Day 2" of the Python bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/),
I learned and practiced converting between Python data types
(i.e. from "string" to "int" datatypes, and etc.).

My assignments created are:
1 - BMI_Calculator.py: a BMI (body mass index) calculator which prompts user for a "height" and "weight"
    float values. After calculating BMI value, the output is converted from
    float to string for printing.

2 - Remaining_life_in_weeks.py: This calculates how many months and weeks the
    user has left in his/her life out of a lifespan of 90. The user inputs
    their current age.

3 - Tips_calculator.py: This calculator prompts for 'bill total', 'tips percentage',
    and 'number of people' to determine how much each person pays for the split bill.
    For example, if the bill is $150, the tips percentage is 12%, and there are 5 people,
    the bill per person calculates at $33.60 (about $3.60 tip paid on top of $30 per person).
