For "Day 3" of the Python bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/),
I learned and practiced Python if-else conditionals and logical operators (>,<,==, etc.).
Main assignments include:

1 - BMI_calculator_2.0.py: An updated BMI (body mass index) calculator which uses
    'height' and 'weight' inputs to calculate BMI. If-else statements are used
    to print if user is 'overweight', 'underweight', etc.

2 - Check_for_leap_year.py: This program uses if-else conditionals to check if
    the year given by the user is a leap year (Ex: 2016 is a lear year, but not 2025).

3 - Love_compatibility_calculator.py: Program prompts user for 2 names with which
    a "love compatibility" score is calculated based on the names. The if-else
    conditionals are used to print/state how strong or weak the compatibility is based on
    the resulting scores.

4 - Odd_or_even.py: checks is a prompted number is odd or even using if-else
    conditionals as well as modulo operator.

5 - Pizza_order_cost_calculator.py: Prompts users on which ingredients to add on their
    pizza order. The if-else conditionals are used to calculate final pizza order cost
    based on which ingredients are chosen.

6 - Rollercoaster_ticket_cost.py: Prompts user for their height (cm) and returns
    rollercoaster ticket cost based on provided height (assumes user is a kid, youth, or adult
    based on given height).

7 - Treasure_island_text_game.py: A text adventure game where the user answers a series
    of questions to get to the treasure. Uses if-else statements to determine if user
    gets questions right or loses game.
