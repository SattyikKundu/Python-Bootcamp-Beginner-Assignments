"Day 4" section of the Python bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/),
covers use of Python's list feature for storing multiple values as well as the use
of Python's import "random" class to take advantage of randomization for my programs.

The below "Day 4" exercises use a combination of list and "import random" python features:

1 - Flip_heads_or_tails.py: Returns random Heads or Tails using Python's random class.

2 - List_practice.py: practice statements using Python's list feature.

3 - Random_name_from_raffle.py : Prompts users for a list of names seprated by commas.
    Then uses random class to return a random name, from list, as winner of a free meal!

4 - Rock_paper_scissors.py: Player picks rock, paper, or scissors. Then computer randomly
    picks one as well. Then if-else conditionals determine win, lose, or draw.

5 - Treasure_map_grid.py: Uses nested list to create a 3x3 grid layout where user
    can bury the treasure. For example, if user inputs "23", the treasure gets
    buried at the intersection of the 2nd column and 3rd row. See below output:
    ['⬜️', '️⬜️', '️⬜️']
    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '️⬜️']
    ['⬜️️', 'X', '⬜️️']
