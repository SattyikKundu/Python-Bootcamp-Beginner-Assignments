For "Day 1" section of my Python Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/),
I learned about variables, inputs, and printing output at the start of my
Python journey.

Besides the practice files, the "brand-name-generator.py" combines the inputs, variables,
and print concepts by creating a new "band name" using 2 strings from the user as input.
